##How to install it

####a. clone it
``bash
git clone https://github.com/seadog007/EasyCal.git
``
####b. change thing in config.js
You only change the Calendar ID [1]
``javascript
var calendarId = 'Your Calendar ID';
``
You need to rename this file to config.js after you change the setting
I will share my Google API key for everybody.
